# Harry-Potter-Quiz-App
## About:
Welcome to my Harry Potter themed quiz application, which I created to expand my knowledge of web development by exploring JavaScript. After gaining a better understanding of HTML and CSS, I wanted to challenge myself with a more dynamic and interactive project. This quiz application allowed me to delve into the world of JavaScript and learn how to create an engaging and user-friendly web application. As a fan of the Harry Potter books, I chose to make the quiz application themed around the series to add a fun and exciting element to the project.
